readFootball()

library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

print(dbListTables(sql_con))
```

## Pipes
la idea es q es lo mismo diferentes maneras de hacerlo
```{r}
head(players)

players %>%
  head
```

```{r}
players %>%
  colnames
```
```{r}
sapply(players, class)


players %>%
  sapply(class)

class %>%
  sapply(players, .)
```



## SELECT ~ select

aqui empÃ¬ezas a comparar dplyr con sql
```{r}
players %>%
  head %>%
  select(player_name, birthday)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT player_name
,   birthday
FROM Player
LIMIT 6
")
```

## WHERE ~ filter

```{r}
players %>%
  filter(birthday >= "1998") %>%
  head
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player
WHERE birthday >= 1998
LIMIT 6
")
```

## ORDER ~ arrange

```{r}
players %>%
  arrange(birthday) %>%
  head
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player
ORDER BY birthday
LIMIT 6
")
```

## aggregators ~ summarise

```{r}
players %>%
  summarise(weight=mean(weight), height=mean(height))
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT avg(weight) AS weight,
      avg(height) AS height
FROM Player
")

```

## mutate

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight*0.45359237) %>%
  summarise(weight=mean(weight_kg), height=mean(height))
```
```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT avg(weight*0.45359237) AS weight,
      avg(height) AS height
FROM Player
")
```

## GROUP BY

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(weight=mean(weight)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, weight)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
data <- dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(birthday, 1, 4) AS INT) AS year,
      COUNT(1) AS n,
          avg(weight)
FROM player
GROUP BY year
")
data
```



```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(nsample=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, nsample)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
players %>%
  mutate(year=as.numeric(substring(birthday, 1, 4))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(weight=mean(weight), nsamples=n()) %>%
  filter(nsamples >= 200) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, weight)) +
  geom_line(colour="darkorange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Exercise

* Translate from SQL to dply or from dply to SQL
```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Match
LIMIT 6
")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT country_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n
FROM Match
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY n DESC
")
```
```{r}
countries
```


```{r}
games %>%
  left_join(countries, by=c("country_id" = "id")) %>%
  select(name, home_team_api_id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(teams = n_distinct(home_team_api_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(teams))
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player_Attributes
LIMIT 6
")

```

* From where do players with higest accuracy come from?

* Add team name and translate to dplyr

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT stage, home_team_api_id, home_team_goal
FROM Match
WHERE country_id = 1
AND season = '2008/2009'
ORDER BY stage
")
```
